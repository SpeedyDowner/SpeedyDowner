- 👋 Hi, I’m @SpeedyDowner, I work in a restaurant in Southeastern Europe and have been doing all sort of breakbacking work since my teen years
- I can say that I lead quite a depressing life. Underpayed, living that Slavic kind of mediocre dead-end job type of life..
- Since I know how much more I can achieve in this life, I don't want to spend it like this. I'm completely new to this world, despite being 31 yrs-old
- These are skills which could change my life (so I'll give it my best to just keep going forward )
- I can learn to make anything from my wild imagination, a reality (maybe virtual :))
- So, combining coding with my other interests (linguistics, caligraphy, airplanes, history), I can actually make some unique stuff and designs for whatever,
- Whereever the road takes me.. who knows where I might stray .. I might end up as a web designer, or developing apps or games.. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code for starters in HTML+CSS and then JAVASCRIPT  or/and Python 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...HTML CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...For starters, any help and tips are welcome and I'd be more than grateful 
- 📫 How to reach me ...alexkid112233@gmail.com
